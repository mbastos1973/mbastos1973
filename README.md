Hi!
My name is Marcelo Bastos, I am 48 years old;
I am currently a Physiotherapist, working in a hospital environment;
I like IT, especially programming, although I have little knowledge about it. I find Python an extremely interesting programming language, so much so that I want to learn as much about it. I would like to get to the point of using Python in my main area of expertise (health), at least with data and statistics, and my big dream is to use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of people.
